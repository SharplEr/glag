**G1** (Garbage First) is default GC since JDK 11.

G1 is trying to keep balance between latency and throughput.

So you may expect pauses about 10-1000 ms and 5-15% of throughput cost.

G1 is regions based GC with generations.

Young generation is collected with pause 
and old generation is collected concurrently.
